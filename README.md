## *Overview*

This study delves deep into understanding the effects of asteroid impacts on our planet. By simulating and visualizing various scenarios, we aim to gain insights into the aftereffects of such cosmic collisions.

---

## *Dataset*

Our study divides the dataset into three parts based on the asteroid's diameter, impact angle, and other characteristics. 

- *Series 11:* Diameter of 100m, 45 degrees' momentum, with variations in airbursts.
- *Series 31:* Diameter of 250m, with variations in momentum angles and airbursts.

## *Visualization Process*

Utilizing advanced visualization techniques, we analyzed the effects of various asteroid impacts on water. We meticulously divided the data into different parts, and focused on various characteristics, angles, and diameters of asteroids.

---

## *Key Findings*

- Asteroids with a diameter of 100m, regardless of airburst elevation, didn't generate significant water waves.
- 250m diameter asteroids, especially those with a 60-degree momentum, caused more water displacement.
- Airbursts, depending on elevation, can drastically reduce the impact effect on water.
